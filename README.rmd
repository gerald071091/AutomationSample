THIS IS A SAMPLE PROJECT WHICH CAN BE USED FOR LEARNING PURPOSES

THIS PROJECT IS ALL ABOUT USING SELENIUM TO AUTOMATE WEB BROWSING
C# IS THE SELECTED LANGUAGE IN THIS PROJECT BUT YOU CAN USE JAVA OR PYTHON

FOR REFERENCES YOU CAN USE THE FOLLOWING SITES TO LEARN THE BASIC FUNDAMENTALS:

SELENIUM:
* http://toolsqa.com/selenium-c-sharp/
* https://automatetheplanet.com/

UNIT TESTING:
* http://nunit.org/docs/2.2/quickStart.html

-The chrome options for this steps is included in PageConfiguration.cs file

DEVELOPMENT TOOL USED:
* Visual Studio 2017 (but you can used earlier version)

As you will notice there are 3 projects included in this solution.
* AutoCore
* PortableTestRunner
* TestRunner

AutoCore:
- This is the heart of the solution wherein the automation process takes place and it provides
  the necessary services and functionalities that other projects relies on this.
  
PortableTestRunner:
- This is a sample project that makes the automation user friendly since you'll only need to 
  run the application itself. You can see the application named "PortableTestRunner.exe" in 
  PortableTestRunner/Bin/Debug.
  
TestRunner:
- I'll recommend this project if you want to learn more about using selenium with unit testing
  since this is the ideal setup for running automation and providing observable behavior in the
  long run.
